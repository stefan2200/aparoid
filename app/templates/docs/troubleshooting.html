    By default the application will monitor and print all executed adb commands to the console.
    In case of errors please check the adb command and output. If any errors are being produced you might be able to pinpoint the source of the problem.

    I know using adb with many parallel processes (reverse proxy, shell commands, frida, etc.) can get a bit messy and sometimes commands fail for no reason. If something does not work on the first attempt, just refresh the page and try again.
